Interactive map

How to use:

You have to run the app by clicking index.html.  

search for any place by typing and below are the first 5 places in the list relevant to what you type and if you select that then you can see the place that has a marker in place then if you click on the marker then some information will come and a link will come to view it on google maps and if you click on that link it will take you to goggle maps.

Thank You.
